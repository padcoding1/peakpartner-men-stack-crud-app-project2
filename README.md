PeakPartner, a demonstration of a Full Stack (MEN) app with CRUD operations, is a platform where climbers and expedition leaders can register for and plan trips expeditions, respectively. **Expedition Leaders** can create scheduled **Expeditions** and **Climbers** can register for them. Climbers can see the **Destination** of a trip and the **Trip Dates**. In order to **register for a trip** and **join an Expedition**, or for any **expedition tasks (create, schedule, delete, add/remove climbers)**, all users must have an account with the appropriate **access level**. A registered user can have a **Climber** account or an **Expedition Leader** account. Leader accounts are essentially **Power Users**, capable of managing users and expeditions.

PeakPartner allows all app visitors to:
-Sign Up
-Sign In
-Sign Out
-View Current Expeditions (dates and destinations only)

Users may:
-Create, view, edit, and remove their own expedition registrations

Power Users may also:
-Create, view, edit, and remove their own expedition registrations
-Add/remove users from any expedition
-Change expedition details (date, destination, etc)

API access to forecasted weather
API access to destination location
